## Known issue

- LRCX specs uses indexes of [grapheme clusters] when processing inline tags
  concerning text offset. The ported `lyrics-kit` has not yet implemented this
  feature and counting by the default JavaScript string length (UTF-16 encoded
  length) instead for now. This may result in a discrepancy when rendering
  lyrics with LyricsX.
